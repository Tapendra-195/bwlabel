<pre>#BWLabel for c++
Matlab's bwlabel function for c++. I'm using OpenCV to handle image but that can easily be changed. Change cv::Mat to your image data type.
# Takes input image and outputs vector array containing group tag(id) for each pixels, which has same pixel location as input image.
# BwLabel b;
# std::vector<std::vector<int>> labeled_image = b.find_label(input_image);
